   9 PM Dear Diary,
Today while I was cleaning my cupboard, I want some old pictures of me and my sisters. We all were laughing a lot in this picture. I believe that it should be some really funny moment. Another moment was captured, when I was hiding and eating chocolates from my Father\u2019s pocket so that I don\u2019t have to share with anyone.
A picture of us where we are wearing lehengas was also there. It was one of our cousin\u2019s sister\u2019s marriages and we decided to wear lehengas as our dress code. Some pictures made me laugh and some made me cry. Of course, it\u2019s the memories that are all left, later.
In the past religious faith used to be a great prop to human beings in times of distress or misfortune. The belief that whatever God did was for the good of human beings served as a great-consolation to people when a natural calamity fell upon them.

The difficulties, disappointments and failures were attributed to God\u2019s will and people bowed without much questioning. But now those spiritual beliefs have more or less gone. We now ask if life has any purpose at all. We now feel confused and perplexed.

The decline in religious faith has led also to the loss of the spiritual values of life. Our forefathers had the ideal of charity, sympathy, fellow-feeling, brotherhood of man, etc. Now people have become utterly materialistic and pleasure minded. Everyone wants to make as much money as possible by fair means or foul.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Honesty and integrity are things of the past. Now there is a mad scramble for money and power.
In a way, however, we are happier than our forefathers. Our forefathers were the victims of illiteracy, ignorance and superstitions. Ignorance might mean bliss, but this is the bliss of intellectual non-existence or mental blankness. We today are literate and educated. We now know many secrets of nature which were unknown to our forefathers. We experience an intellectual thrill when we acquire more and more knowledge. We have not more or less got rid of superstitions and imaginary fears, nor are we any more victims of a sense of fatalism.
Our forefathers used to attribute everything to the will of fate. But we now feel that our fate is in our own hands. We experience a sort of liberation from the restrictive influence of fate.

If we talk of wealth, it is today more equitably distributed than before. Socialistic trends all over the world have narrowed the gap between the rich and the poor. In the days of our forefathers, poverty was regarded as part of the divine scheme of things and was passively accepted by the people.

ADVERTISEMENTS:



Now the attitude towards poverty has greatly changed. Poverty is now looked upon as an evil which can be, and must be, removed. The rich classes do not now have that sense of complacency and they do not now take their wealth for granted.

We are also happier in the sense that we enjoy better health than our forefathers. Various discoveries and inventions by science have made it possible to prevent diseases, to eliminate or cure them. We live cleaner lives, in accordance with the rules of sanitation than our forefathers could ever do.

Good health depends much of the happiness of mankind, and the health of mankind today is better than ever before. Physical fitness keeps us happy and enables us to derive genuine pleasure from eating, drinking, sports and games and all sorts of recreational activities.

Total we have greater freedom than our forefathers had. Freedom too is an essential condition of happiness. We no longer feel wretched because of any rigid restraints. Woman is today emancipated. The young are no longer in the tight grip of their elders but enjoy a measure of independence unknown before.

ADVERTISEMENTS:



The joint family system in our country has crumbled, thus diminishing greatly the wretchedness and misery of those who were its victims. There is greater freedom to love, and here too parental control over boys and girls has been considerably relaxed.

Physical comforts have gone up. Scientific inventions of our times have made life easier by greatly diminishing the need for manual labour or physical exertion. We have more leisure and along with leisure we have many more sources of pleasure. Physical comfort, leisure and pleasure have surely increased and augmented human happiness.

Graduate School Statement of Purpose
Task: Please write a short essay (500 to 1,000 words) about yourself and your interest in
science. You do not need to write about astronomy or space, and you are encouraged to
be creative. If you wish, you can say something about topics in astronomy that are of
particular interest to you. Your essay is an important part of your application and will be
read carefully.
In my family there is a tradition of interest in science: my grandmother was
college professor in chemistry and physics, and both my parents were trained as
mechanical engineers in college. When I was a kid, my mom showed me a box full of
extremely tiny gears \u2013 those that table clocks are made out of \u2013 and told me what each
part was for, and I remember thinking \u2015this is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u2016 I have
been interested in mechanical structures and the inner working of human-made and
natural things ever since.
My interest in natural structures and systems began with photography. I find it an
almost magical technique of preserving any natural phenomenon from large to small. It
also gives me a chance to look at things very closely and wonder about them for as long
as I like. I took photographs extensively when I travelled in China, and later in my first
year of college. My interests intensified and went beyond just apparent forms, when
during my first summer in college I read about linear and nonlinear dynamics, emergence
behavior, game theory, neuroscience and spatio-temporal pattern formation in books
intended for undergraduate students or the general public. I decided that my appreciation
for nature would only deepen and advance if I learned about the underlying theory of the
nature of beauty, instead of just the beauty itself. I\u2019m also more and more convinced that
we can gain insights into the very large structures in our universe by looking at smaller
structures like cellular pathways or subatomic particles.
In order to understand the physical world further, I enrolled in both physics and
mathematics programs. Even with the strong theoretical emphasis in my curriculum
choice, I still find physically touching, seeing and manipulating things among the best
ways to understand them. I enjoy doing lab works in physics, and I have worked in a
machine shop, sculpture studio, art museum, and taxidermy studio. However, the
elegance, simplicity, and power of theory are even more appealing to me as a scientist.
As I acquire more and more background in mathematics, I realize what a powerful
language and metaphor it is to science. I enjoy engaging myself in philosophical
arguments about the nature of mathematics and physics with my physics and astronomy
professor Dr. Robert Harmon and my best friend in college who is a neuroscience student.
My research project last summer was on an eclipsing binary star system, LV
Hercules, which has high orbit eccentricity. From the beginning of the project, I was very
enthusiastic about teaching myself observational astronomy from scratch. The project
was sponsored by the Arkansas Center for Space & Planetary Sciences at the University
of Arkansas, a new research center consisting of mechanical engineers, chemical
engineers, astronomers, biologists and cosmologists. I enjoyed the interdisciplinary group
dynamics during weekly seminars, while at the same time working in the physics 
2
research building, where I could talk to other physicists about their work on material
science, numeric and computation, or quantum optics.
During the process of learning about the universe \u2013 seeing, touching,
experimenting, thinking, and researching--I also have learned about myself. I find the
only way I can learn anything meaningful is to ask \u2015why,\u2016 which is the central thread of
any inquiry \u2013 experimental, theoretical, philosophical or intellectual. I always try to find
the boundary to the chain of knowledge or reasoning. For example, in the world of
astrophysics, I find the jets from black holes and pulsars interesting, I find cosmic
background radiation interesting, and I find the origin of universe intriguing, since we do
not know how these phenomena have come into being.
My liberal art education also has provided me inspiration and reflection on
science education. Having found that college science outreach consists almost entirely of
cool demonstrations of scientific phenomenon, I tried to create another area of interest in
science and scientific thinking, by demonstrating the power of reasoning, logic and
critical thinking. That was the main objective when I gathered students and faculty
members and created the Freethinkers Club on campus last fall. We discussed the
teaching of the theory of evolution in public schools, and pseudoscientific influence in
public policy making. We tripled the size of our mailing list after just one semester.
The liberal arts approach gives me opportunities to explore all these different
experiences and ways of learning. I want to continue exploring the beauty and elegance
of our universe in my life, my studies, and my career. For me, seeking out and
understanding such mysteries\u2014large and small\u2014is like discovering and collecting jewels,
or something even more elegant, like the tiny gears of a mechanical clock.
